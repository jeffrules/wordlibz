# Setup

This is a boilerplate [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) + [React](https://react.dev/) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) app.

## 0. Clone the repository

## 1. Install node.js

I recommend doing this through **nvm** (Node Version Manager)[Linux / Mac](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)[Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).  

## 2. Install The Project Version Of Node, Use It, And Install Dependencies

Once nvm is installed, *from the project root*, do:


```
nvm install && nvm use
```


then run 

```
npm install
```

to install the app

# Run It

Once npm installs the packages, you can run the development server with:

```
npm run dev
```
